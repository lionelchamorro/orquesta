"""CES-4 · api-schemas-extra-forbid — compliant API request/response schemas (Pydantic v2).

Drop-in / comparison template for schemas living under
``<pkg>/api/<version>/schemas/{requests,responses}/``. Every request and response model at the
API boundary sets ``model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` so an unknown field (a typo, a
stale client, an injected key) is rejected with a 422 instead of being silently ignored.

Internal/domain models are NOT subject to this rule — it is scoped by placement to the api/
schema packages. See ``.agents/rules/api-schemas-extra-forbid.md`` for the full rule.
