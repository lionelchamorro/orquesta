"""CES-64 · test-in-memory-adapters — a working in-memory port implementation.

A fake is a *real* implementation of the same Protocol the production adapter implements — not a
mock. Tests drive logic through it (CES-65: through the interface), assert on outcomes, and stay
millisecond-fast and deterministic.

Drop this beside your tests (e.g. ``tests/fakes/in_memory_repository.py``) and inject it where the
real SQL/HTTP adapter would go. See ``.agents/rules/test-in-memory-adapters.md`` for the rule.
